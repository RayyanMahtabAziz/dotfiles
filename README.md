# dotfiles

üõ†Ô∏è My personal dotfiles for GitHub Codespaces, Visual Studio Code, and terminal environments.

## What's Included

- **.bashrc**  
  Custom aliases and environment variables for faster terminal usage.

- **.gitconfig**  
  Git settings for author name, email, and default editor.

These files are automatically loaded into every Codespace I create.  
They help maintain a consistent and personalized development environment.
